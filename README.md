# tsa-sdev-proj
A repository for creating a project for the TSA software development competition.

### Organization system:
The 'Project' folder should hold all files related to the code.  It should be structured like a NetBeans project file, such that it can be easily opened and edited by anyone.
The 'Presentation' folder should hold all files related to the presentation.  Be sure to label everything clearly, so that even someone not familiar with the system can get to the main presentation.

### Getting set up:
The latest build is automatically gitignored to avoid merge conflicts; you will have to build the jar file yourself.  Just import the 'Project' folder into netbeans, and edit as you will.
Spamming PRs is discouraged, and shoddy commit logs will cause me to furrow my brow deeply in your general direction.
If you indent your code with spaces instead of tabs, you will be tied to the stack and given 100 lashes with a Cat5 cable.

### Common sense:
DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY TO MASTER YOU CHUCKLEFUCKS.  Make a dev branch for yourself, which will then be PRed into the main dev, which then will be merged into master.

Note to self: Revise for politeness.
